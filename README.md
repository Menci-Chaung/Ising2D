## Abstact

In this project, we studied the Monte Carlo method to calculate statistical properties of a classical system because of its pedagogical popularity, instructional value and physical importance. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations for Ising Model in 2D. We have considered two algorithms to simulate Ising Model, they are Metropolis algorithm and Wolff algorithm and we compared these two algorithms. After studying and demonstrating the Metropolis algorithm, we discuss the so called ”critical slowing down” problem towards the critical temperature. A solution to this problem is given by the Wolff algorithm which is discussed at the end.
